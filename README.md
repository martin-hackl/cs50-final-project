- In the Tap Tempo section you can press any key or click a button to calculate the BPM (beats per minute) of a song you are listening.
- In the Tuner section you can playback individual audiofiles of a guitar strum to tune your guitar. The sounds will be buffered into cache when opening the page so the sounds can be played immediatly when you are clicking the buttons.
